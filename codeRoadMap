Which programming language and which framework ?
the app utilizes python and django


Which DB uses the app ?
Postgres
all the properties about the db are contained in the settings.py file


How is the application structured ?
    the application is divided in 2 big parts:
        - users related the user management (log in, log out, registration)
        - scans_logs related to the scans/customers management


How is structured each single part ?

Each part has the following structure
- models.py contains the class that reflects the database structure
- urls.py is the file where you specify the path of the page you are going to create
- view.py contains the functions that are executed when a certain request on a certain url is done
        for example the index function is the function which is executed when you are on the home page of the app,
        it executes all the queries necessary to display the data in the dashboard.
- templates folder contains the html pages for each url(page) created


Which is the typical workflow to follow when creating a new web page ?
first of all you need to define the new url path in the urls.py and you have to also specify there the name of the function you're going
to create in the view.py that will be executed when you navigate to that page

Then, define and implement the function in the view.py file

Finally, create the html page which will be displayed when the url is followed
